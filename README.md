# Prompt Templates for Stable Diffusion

## Disclaimer
Do these prompts only work with Stable Diffusion? No, they can also be used for [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and other similar projects. In general the results will always depend on the chosen sampling method, dimensions of the image, chosen model and many other factors. The results will be different from the ones shown here, but the overall end results should be in the same ballpark.

It is also to be considered that some prompts will not be working in online (hosted) versions of stable diffusion or other equivalents as there might be some restrictions for reasons like political, nudity or others.

## Purpose of this document
The following prompts are supposed to give an easier entry into getting good results in using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion). Simple prompts can already lead to good outcomes, but sometimes it's in the details on what makes an image believable. The following prompts are mostly collected from different discord servers, websites, fabricated and then modified to match the _best_ results. Some sources for good prompts are [r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/), [lexica.art](https://lexica.art/) or [prompthero.com](https://prompthero.com/). 

## Setup
There are several good instructions on how to set up stable diffusion either at [CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), [r/StableDiffusion/wiki/guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/wiki/guide/) or [rentry.org/voldy](https://rentry.org/voldy).

## Usage
Copy the prompt from the category you want to start with and replace the `{{Prompt}}` part, or any other part in `{{brackets}}` with your personal prompt command. Then feel free to update the prompt to match your vision. All provided prompts can be used both for **txt2img** and **img2img**.

The outcome will differ depending on the used model. While there are already differences between stable diffusion v1, v1.5, v2 or SDXL, there are other models which have been trained on more specific sets of images to resemble certain styles (comic, photograph, specific video games, ...) or improve a certain astetic. Most of these alternative models can be found on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) or [civitai.com](https://civitai.com/). Popular examples would be

* [Openjourney v2](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney-v2)
* [Arcane Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/Arcane-Diffusion)
* [epiCRealism](https://civitai.com/models/25694/epicrealism)
* [Realistic Vision](https://civitai.com/models/4201/realistic-vision-v51)
* [DreamShaper](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper)
